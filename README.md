# README.md for Ledger and Transactions Management System Using MERN Stack

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Ledger and Transactions Management System

**Objective:** This project aims to develop a web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for managing ledger entries and their corresponding transactions. Users will be able to create ledger entries, add transactions, view transactions for a selected ledger within specific dates, and generate a PDF report of the transactions.

## Features

- **Ledger Management:** Create and manage ledger entries.
- **Transactions Management:** Add and manage transactions linked to ledgers, including details such as amount, date, and type (Given or Taken).
- **Dashboard:** View all created ledgers and their transactions, with filtering options by date.
- **PDF Generation:** Generate PDF reports of transactions for selected ledgers within specified date ranges.
- **Data Security:** Ensure data is encrypted in MongoDB and protected from unauthorized access.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing ledger and transaction data.
- **Express:** Web framework for Node.js to build the backend API.
- **React:** Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side programming.
- **Mongoose:** ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **PDF Generation Library:** For creating PDF reports (e.g., pdfkit).

## Setup and Configuration

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the backend directory.
   - Install necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install express mongoose dotenv
     ```
   - Set up a MongoDB database and configure the connection string in a `.env` file.

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory.
   - Install necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install react react-dom axios
     ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - Start the frontend development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

## Backend Implementation

- Create API endpoints for:
  - Creating new ledgers.
  - Adding transactions to ledgers.
  - Retrieving transactions for a specific ledger within a date range.
  - Generating PDF reports of transactions.

## Frontend Implementation

- Develop forms for creating ledgers and adding transactions.
- Create a dashboard to display all ledgers.
- Implement functionality to select a ledger and filter transactions by date.
- Integrate PDF generation functionality.

## Data Security

- Ensure that data stored in MongoDB is encrypted.
- Implement measures to prevent sensitive data exposure.

## Testing and Validation

- Conduct thorough testing to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
- Validate that data encryption is implemented correctly and securely.
